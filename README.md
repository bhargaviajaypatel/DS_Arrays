# DS_Arrays
Array is a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 
1. Insertion Operation:- To insert an element from an array a user will enter the position at which the array elements insertion is required.
2. Deletion Operation;- To delete or remove an element from an array,a user will enter the position at which the array elements deletion is required. Deleting an element does not affect the size of the array. It also checks whether deletion is possible or not, for example, if an array contains five elements and user wants to delete the elements at the sixth position, it is not possible.
